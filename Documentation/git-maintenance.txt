NAME
----
git-maintenance - Run tasks to optimize Git repository data


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git maintenance' run [<options>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git commands
and reducing storage requirements for the repository.
+
Git commands that add repository data, such as `git add` or `git fetch`,
are optimized for a responsive user experience. These commands do not take
time to optimize the Git data, since such optimizations scale with the full
size of the repository while these user commands each perform a relatively
small action.
+
The `git maintenance` command provides flexibility for how to optimize the
Git repository.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

run::
	Run one or more maintenance tasks. If one or more `--task` options
	are specified, then those tasks are run in that order. Otherwise,
	the tasks are determined by which `maintenance.<task>.enabled`
	config options are true. By default, only `maintenance.gc.enabled`
	is true.

TASKS
-----

commit-graph::
	The `commit-graph` job updates the `commit-graph` files incrementally,
	then verifies that the written data is correct. If the new layer has an
	issue, then the chain file is removed and the `commit-graph` is
	rewritten from scratch.
+
The verification only checks the top layer of the `commit-graph` chain.
If the incremental write merged the new commits with at least one
existing layer, then there is potential for on-disk corruption being
carried forward into the new file. This will be noticed and the new
commit-graph file will be clean as Git reparses the commit data from
the object database.
+
The incremental write is safe to run alongside concurrent Git processes
since it will not expire `.graph` files that were in the previous
`commit-graph-chain` file. They will be deleted by a later run based on
the expiration delay.

prefetch::
	The `prefetch` task updates the object directory with the latest
	objects from all registered remotes. For each remote, a `git fetch`
	command is run. The refmap is custom to avoid updating local or remote
	branches (those in `refs/heads` or `refs/remotes`). Instead, the
	remote refs are stored in `refs/prefetch/<remote>/`. Also, tags are
	not updated.
+
This is done to avoid disrupting the remote-tracking branches. The end users
expect these refs to stay unmoved unless they initiate a fetch.  With prefetch
task, however, the objects necessary to complete a later real fetch would
already be obtained, so the real fetch would go faster.  In the ideal case,
it will just become an update to bunch of remote-tracking branches without
any object transfer.

gc::
	Cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the local repository. "GC"
	stands for "garbage collection," but this task performs many
	smaller tasks. This task can be rather expensive for large
	repositories, as it repacks all Git objects into a single pack-file.
	It can also be disruptive in some situations, as it deletes stale
	data.

loose-objects::
	The `loose-objects` job cleans up loose objects and places them into
	pack-files. In order to prevent race conditions with concurrent Git
	commands, it follows a two-step process. First, it deletes any loose
	objects that already exist in a pack-file; concurrent Git processes
	will examine the pack-file for the object data instead of the loose
	object. Second, it creates a new pack-file (starting with "loose-")
	containing a batch of loose objects. The batch size is limited to 50
	thousand objects to prevent the job from taking too long on a
	repository with many loose objects.

incremental-repack::
	The `incremental-repack` job repacks the object directory
	using the `multi-pack-index` feature. In order to prevent race
	conditions with concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step
	process. First, it deletes any pack-files included in the
	`multi-pack-index` where none of the objects in the
	`multi-pack-index` reference those pack-files; this only happens
	if all objects in the pack-file are also stored in a newer
	pack-file. Second, it selects a group of pack-files whose "expected
	size" is below the batch size until the group has total expected
	size at least the batch size; see the `--batch-size` option for
	the `repack` subcommand in linkgit:git-multi-pack-index[1]. The
	default batch-size is zero, which is a special case that attempts
	to repack all pack-files into a single pack-file.

OPTIONS
-------
--auto::
	When combined with the `run` subcommand, run maintenance tasks
	only if certain thresholds are met. For example, the `gc` task
	runs when the number of loose objects exceeds the number stored
	in the `gc.auto` config setting, or when the number of pack-files
	exceeds the `gc.autoPackLimit` config setting.

--quiet::
	Do not report progress or other information over `stderr`.

--task=<task>::
	If this option is specified one or more times, then only run the
	specified tasks in the specified order.
