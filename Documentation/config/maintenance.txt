maintenance.<task>.enabled::
	This boolean config option controls whether the maintenance task
	with name `<task>` is run when no `--task` option is specified.
	By default, only `maintenance.gc.enabled` is true.

maintenance.commit-graph.auto::
	This integer config option controls how often the `commit-graph` task
	should be run as part of `git maintenance run --auto`. If zero, then
	the `commit-graph` task will not run with the `--auto` option. A
	negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a
	positive value implies the command should run when the number of
	reachable commits that are not in the commit-graph file is at least
	the value of `maintenance.commit-graph.auto`. The default value is
	100.
